DESIGN SYSTEM FOUNDATION
1. Core Color Palette
Brand Colors

Primary Green
Hex: #448a33
Role: Primary actions, confirmations, growth indicators
Light Mode: Used as-is for buttons, highlights, active states
Dark Mode: Lightened semantic variant to preserve contrast on dark surfaces

Primary Blue
Hex: #3b5a65
Role: Secondary actions, navigation accents, informational elements
Light Mode: Used for secondary buttons, links, charts
Dark Mode: Lightened semantic variant for readability on dark backgrounds

Both brand colors must maintain WCAG 2.1 AA contrast compliance against background and surface colors in both themes.

Semantic Color System

All semantic colors must exist as role-based tokens rather than raw hex usage.

Success
Purpose: Confirmations, completed states, positive feedback
Light Mode: Derived from Primary Green with reduced chroma
Dark Mode: Higher lightness variant to avoid dullness on dark surfaces

Error
Purpose: Destructive actions, validation failures
Light Mode: Red derivative with sufficient contrast on white
Dark Mode: Softer red with higher lightness to reduce eye strain

Warning
Purpose: Risk alerts, cautionary states
Light Mode: Yellow or amber derivative with dark foreground
Dark Mode: Muted amber with light foreground text

Info
Purpose: Informational banners, tooltips, neutral notices
Light Mode: Derived from Primary Blue
Dark Mode: Elevated lightness blue to separate from background

Neutral Palette

Neutrals are semantic and scale-based, not named by color.

Light Mode Neutral Scale
Near-white background
Surface white
Light gray border
Mid gray muted text
Dark gray foreground

Dark Mode Neutral Scale
Near-black background
Dark surface
Dark gray border
Mid gray muted text
Near-white foreground

Each neutral step must be tested for contrast against adjacent roles such as text, icons, and dividers.

2. Dark Mode Strategy

Dark mode is semantic, not inverted.

Backgrounds become low-light neutral surfaces
Text becomes near-white with softened contrast
Brand colors shift toward higher lightness and moderate chroma
Borders and dividers rely on opacity and subtle contrast
Charts use adjusted brand hues to prevent color vibration

No pure black or pure white is allowed in dark mode to reduce eye fatigue.

3. Typography Scale
Font Family

Primary Sans Serif
Recommended: Inter or Manrope
Fallback: System UI stack

Optional Monospace
Use for data, code, identifiers

Fonts must support clear numerals and financial data readability.

Type Hierarchy

H1: Page-level headlines
H2: Section headers
H3: Subsections
H4 to H6: Supporting hierarchy

Body: Primary reading text
Small: Secondary text, metadata
Caption: Labels, helper text
Button: Medium weight, slightly increased letter spacing
Label: Medium weight, compact line height

Weights

Regular
Medium
Semibold
Bold

Avoid excessive weight jumps between hierarchy levels.

Line Heights

Headings: Tight but readable
Body: Comfortable for long-form reading
Small text: Slightly increased for legibility

Line heights should adapt responsively on smaller screens.

4. Spacing System
Base Unit

Base spacing unit: 4px or 8px grid
All spacing tokens must be multiples of the base unit

Spacing Scale

xs
sm
md
lg
xl
2xl
3xl

Used consistently across padding, margin, gaps, and layout rhythm.

Layout Usage

Container padding scales by breakpoint
Grid gaps follow spacing scale
Section margins use lg to 2xl spacing
Card padding uses md to lg spacing

Whitespace is treated as a primary design element, especially in fintech contexts where clarity and trust are critical.

5. Implementation Principle

All colors, typography, and spacing must be referenced via tokens or CSS variables. No hardcoded values are allowed in components.

Light mode and dark mode must be fully interchangeable without changing component logic.
