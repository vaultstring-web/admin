Purpose

Allow controlled intervention when automated rate feeds fail or become unreliable.

Manual Rate Override

Override actions must require:

Manual overrides cannot bypass approval workflow.
Only one active override may exist at a time.
Reverting to automated rates must be an explicit action.

10. Performance and Reliability
